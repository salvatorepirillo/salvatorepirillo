# Hi there, I'm Salvatore Pirillo üëã

**Full Stack Software Engineer** specializing in scalable architectures and mission-critical systems.

I design end-to-end solutions that optimize performance up to 95% by combining technical expertise and business acumen. From my Computer Engineering degree to experience in complex systems (trading, IoT, IP cameras, digital marketing), I apply engineering principles to create architectures that scale under pressure.

**Focus:** Legacy system re-engineering, algorithmic optimization, and custom AI solutions with measurable results.

## üîê Note on Private Work

Most of my professional projects are hosted on **Bitbucket** due to client confidentiality requirements. I primarily work on:
- **Full Stack Web Development** (React, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL)
- **Cloud & DevOps** (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS)
- **API & Real-time Applications** (GraphQL, WebSockets, REST)

While my professional work remains private, I actively contribute to open-source projects and maintain personal repositories here on GitHub.
